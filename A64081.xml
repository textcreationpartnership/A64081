            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WEre your Lordſhip here, you would not ſo much admire that you have not Money remitted you: <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> hath in ſeveral Bodies of old and new raiſed Men 30000, 24000 of which have neither Pay nor any Subſiſtence but what they take from the Country, who are alſo Robbed of their Corn and Cattle, twenty, thirty, forty at a time, inſomuch that ſome Farmers are fled with their Rent in their Pockets: Some have left all the Robbers left them, and are gone for<hi>England;</hi> where we hear many good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of them want Bread; many more would go, but cannot make Money of any thing: the beſt <hi>Engliſh</hi>Cow is offered for Ten Shillings, and all other Stock proportionable; nay, ſome have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed black Cattel at Elve Pound a Score, and cannot get it. For three Weeks paſt there hath not been bought or ſold the value of Twenty Pound, beſides what is abſolutely neceſſary for ſupport of Life, in this City, where Money is ſo ſcarce that one Neighbour will not truſt another for Two pence. <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> hath declared, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect Money for the King's Revenue, but will take the value in Kinde of the growth of the Country; and how it will be livied, that way your Lordſhip may imagine. Four Thouſand perſons have deſerted<hi>Dublin,</hi> and more than Eight Thouſand other parts, and gone out of the Kingdom; thoſe that remain ſecure, only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for flight; and unleſs ſome ſpeedy ſtop; by Protection f<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Engliſh,</hi> to pretend a Title to any thing in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And thoſe of them that are rich, have given great Sums for ſupport of a War, which the Prieſts and Fryers call a Holy War, and preach Damnation to all who Aſſiſt not in Purſe or Perſon. The Lord Mayor of <hi>Dublin</hi> hath given 6000 l.the late Lord Mayor, Sir <hi>T.

So that they expect in three Months a Bank of Five Hundred Thouſand Pounds. To which may be added, the Encouragement given this Week from the <hi>French</hi> King, by the Marqueſs <hi>Du Ponte,</hi> who hath brought Arms and Ammunition for 15000 Men, and aſſured more Men and Money, and this day went hence for <hi>Waterford,</hi> where he Embarques back for <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> fear nothing but an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Army of 20000 Horſe and Foot, and the Proteſtants, that they will not come time enough to deliver them.</p>

            <p>THE warmth and flames of this Debate, kindled by the Subject Matter thereof, hath proceeded ſo far, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe us ſo much among ourſelves into Paſſion; and I hope that thoſe flames will never reach to the Deſtruction of this Noble City, and the Inhabitants thereof: The Queſtion is, Whether the Circumſtances wherein we are, it be adviſeable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55607:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 14 -->to Burn this City? The matter in debate, is of great weight, and, as I conceive, of as equal concernment to the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> as to the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> intereſted and Reſiding therein; for if we ſhall conſider the Freehold, Goods, and Chattels belonging to the one or the other, you ſhall not find any great difference in the Value: Why, therefore, ſhould we deſtroy thoſe whom we effect, and are bound to preſerve, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether whith thoſe whom we think fit to puniſh; for we know that in the flames of a general Conflagration, the Intereſt of one and the other cannot be diſtinguiſhed. In the next place it's to be conſidered, how far the whole Country, and Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may be concerned in ſo vaſt a Diſtraction; Conſider how much the Country will be impoveriſhed by deſtroying their great Commerce with the City; and whether Lands in the Country will continue in the half Value they now bear, ſhould they be deprived of venting their Corn, Cattle, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Commodities in this City: Conſider furthermore, that according to the Rules hithertofore obſerved in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of War, nothing can prove more dangerous, than for the over maſtered Party, or at leaſt fear to be ſuch; What can be reaſon to burn ſo famous, ſo great, ſo opulent a City, as we are now poſſeſt of? If we be, or ſhall ſoon be upon the acceſs of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, or burning of this City, will prove an Example to them, at whoſe mercy we ſhall lye, to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the whole Country with Fire and Sword; and then it will be known, that our Party, tho' not ſo much concerned in the Freehold of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are greater Maſters of Corn both in Field and Haggard; which they, upon ſo great provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would ſet on fire, whereas now they have no deſign to deſtroy the Country, or the Inhabitants thereof, they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than to deliver the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> from the the terrour of a new raiſed Army of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and the ſetling of them in ſafety; ſo that unleſs we ſhould begin Acts of Hoſtility, ſuch as the burning of <hi>Dublin</hi> would be, the whole body of the Country and City, Inhabitants thereof, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the common Souldiers, laying down their Arms, may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their former Callings without being further queſtioned, leaving the Landed Officers of the new raiſed <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces, whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſo much been terrified, together

               <!-- PDF PAGE 15 -->with the Unqualified Judges, and Civil Officers, to the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of the Law, or to the Mercy of thoſe who do or ſhall bear ſway in <hi>England;</hi> Furthermore, we cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that the burning of Houſes is Treaſon by the Law of <hi>Ireland,</hi> How great a Treaſon therefore would it be to burn this famous City? If a War were ſo ſeverely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted againſt us, as by Force to drive all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants out of this Kingdom, leaving no hope ever for us to return again, it might then ſeem, perhaps, reaſonable to deſtroy the Country and City; but no Hoſtile Act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intended, to the Diſquiet of the Nation, the whole ſcope of the Power of <hi>England</hi> being no more than to give vigour to the Laws of the Kingdom and the Exerciſe thereof: Why ſhould we burn <hi>Dublin</hi> ingaging our ſelves and the whole Nation in a War, and thereby bring Miſery to our ſelves and the whole Nation, under pretence of doing that which we are no way able to effect? Let us therefore by a wiſe ſubmiſſion, while our Adverſaries are on the other ſide of the Water (and I know the Officers and Souldiers of the old Army will conſent) paſſifie them, by ondering a general lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of Arms, which I am confident, will, not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the whole <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation from Deſtruction, th<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="2 letters">
